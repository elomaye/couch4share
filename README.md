# Every journey start with a single step


Let's build a free, solid, safe community.

Share experiences, places and help build it so it 
will be yours forever.

We ca  use this platform to create the main project
and then build the system starting with:
 - functional website;
 - servers infrastructure;

 - community schemes (trust structure);
 - security schemes (trust pyramid, F2A,etc)
 - issues reporting / sorting
 - note tbc later
